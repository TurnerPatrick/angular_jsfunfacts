<h1>Promises</h1>

<p>Promises simplify deferred and asynchronous computations. A promise represents an operation that hasn't completed yet.</p>

<p>A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future: either a resolved value, or a reason that itâ€™s not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending. Promise users can attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled value or the reason for rejection.</p>
